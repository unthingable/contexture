TODOs for 1.0 release:

== Separate processor from context

== Add standalone mode for testing

Via a dummy queue backend.

== Lazy contexts: simple log function

To be called from anywhere

== gevent support?

== History support
Tell contexture which attributes to keep history for.

== "persisted" objects (like "transient" but always alive)
* persisted objects never die
* can query for persisted object state
* need a talkback channel

== Multilevel nestable contexts?

a structured data stream can be arbitrarily aggregated; temporal grouping.
Currently grouping is at the level of a single context.

aggregate "snapshots"
prevent lost state

This is a straight path into a distributed streaming object database.
for "small" data

nested transactions?
way to annotate and aggregate by events

== custom attribute serializers?




= Done

== attr del
This reqiures additional metadata in the message.
* add "action" argument
